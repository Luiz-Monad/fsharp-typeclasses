### Basic How-To

The original ReadMe.txt reads as follows

> To open this project:
> 
> 1. Open and Compile /InlineHelper/InlineHelper.fsproj with F# 3.0 then copy InlineHelper.dll to /lib/ : Alternatively or if you don't have F# 3.0 you can download InlineHelper.dll from http://fsharp-typeclasses.googlecode.com/files/fsharp-typeclasses-r118.zip
> 
> 2. Open the project file fsharp-typeclasses.fsproj
>
> 3. Have a look at Scripts.fsx for sample code.

*Note:* The link to Google Code no longer functions, but then you should be using a more recent F# these days, anyway.
